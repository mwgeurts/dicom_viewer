function stats = InitializeStatistics(varargin)
% InitalizeStatistics reads in a cell array of structures and creates a
% uitable compatible cell array (for displaying structure statistics, see 
% ExitDetector.m for more details).
%
% If an atlas is also provided, the structure names will be matched to the 
% atlas and the Dx/Vx values will be used from the atlas.  If not provided, 
% default values will be applied to all structures.
%
% The following variables are required for proper execution: 
%   varargin{1}: structure containing cell array of reference structure 
%       names, color, and volume.  See LoadReferenceStructures for more
%       information.
%   varargin{2} (optional): cell array of atlas names, include/exclude 
%       regex statements, and dx values.  See LoadAtlas for more 
%       information.
%
% The following variables are returned upon succesful completion:
%   stats: cell array of structures containing the following columns:
%       structure name (colored), view flag, vx, plan dx, and DQA dx
